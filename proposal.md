# **The Bestiary**
Repository link: https://github.com/srinivasl1/pfda-final/

### Description
*The Bestiary* will be a short text-based adventure/puzzle game set in a fantastical medieval kingdom. 

### Features
* During the game, the player will read conversations between two children living in the royal castle - Ingram, the sickly crown prince, and Weld, the traveling scribe's apprentice. All story will be told through text passages.
* As the children explore the forest surrounding the castle, they will come across wild and mythical creatures that they document in Weld's bestiary. The player can reference back to the entries in the bestiary at any time. This will be implemented as a class of Creatures, each with unique names, attributes, and descriptions.
* During Ingram and Weld's journey, they will come across obstacles and puzzles that can only be solved by asking for help from one of the creatures in Weld's bestiary. The player will have to find creatures in different regions of the forest to help them complete the tasks ahead. This will be done by keeping a list of Creatures already collected, and referencing their unique attributes to find the ones that will help solve the task.

### Challenges
* To be honest, the Creatures seem overly simple to implement as I'm imagining them now - I want to find more ways to take advantage of the class format, such as playing with inheritance or giving them unique callable abilities.
* I would like to reference old text-based adventure games to find a clean and creative way to format the text that will make up the game. 

### Outcomes
**Ideal Outcome:** A complex text-based game with a playtime of around 30 minutes with a full, satisfying storyline and large cast of creatures that can be added to the bestiary. It would be great if I could transform this into a visual novel in RenPy while preserving the Creature class system in a Python code segment.

**Minimum Viable Outcome:** Proof of concept game around 5-10 minutes demonstrating different explorable areas, random encounters of a few different types of creatures, and a few puzzles or tasks that can be solved by using the correct creatures in the bestiary. 

### Milestones
**Week 1 - Due 11/17** - Implement Creature class, figure out good display system to open bestiary and flip through entries. Begin writing story.

**Week 2 - Due 11/24** - Rough draft of all story and dialogue passages. Solid idea for all puzzles, their placement in the story, and how the creatures tie into that. 

**Week 3 - Due 12/1** - Implement scripted creature discovery in each of the unique game areas. Implement all story and dialogue in code. Format player choice and get prototype working.

**Week 4 - Due 12/6** - Implement random creature discovery in some of the unique game areas along with a few scripted discoveries (stretch goal). Polish writing and formatting. Record commentary video.
